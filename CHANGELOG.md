# Changelog

All notable changes to WhisperX Transcriber are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Windows `run.bat` reuses local `.venv` Python and local or PATH-installed uv,
  downloading uv and Python inside the project when missing. Package installation
  uses uv and resumes when an existing virtual environment lacks dependencies.

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Instant Cancel** — transcription now runs in a separate process that is
  terminated immediately when you click Cancel, instead of waiting for the
  current stage to finish.

### Changed
- **Redesigned interface** — consolidated into a single, fixed-size Transcribe
  screen: file, language, model, device, output formats, save location, and
  options are all in one place. Advanced settings moved behind a dedicated tab.
- Cleaner dropdowns, improved text contrast and readability throughout.
- Activity log now appears only while a job is running and auto-hides when done.

## [v1.1.4] — 2026-06-09

### Changed
- Removed progress bar and cancel button mentions from docs (not yet implemented)

## [v1.1.3] — 2026-06-07

### Added
- Bundled FFmpeg via imageio-ffmpeg — no separate download needed
- Real-time download progress during setup wizard

### Fixed
- FFmpeg resolution now works reliably across all configurations
